# Yeah, my playground (Still playing around not done with project)

# just playing around audio,video and image manipulation (audvidman)

## Thought process 

* An api to remove sound (Audio) from video
[X]: '/api/v1/rm-audio'


* Api to get a video meta-data
[X]: 'api/v1/meta-video'

* Api to extract audio from a particular duration in a video
[X] '/api/v1/ex-audio'
